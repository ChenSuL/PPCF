##Dependencies
- Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org)
- Cython 0.20.1 (http://cython.org)
- numpy 1.8.1 (http://www.scipy.org)
- scipy 0.13.3 (http://www.scipy.org)

The benchmarks are implemented with a combination of Python and C++. The framework is built on Python for simplicity, and the core functions of each algorithm are written in C++ for efficiency consideration. To achieve so, [Cython](http://cython.org/ "Cython's Web page") (a language to write C/C++ extensions for Python) has been employed to compile the C++ extensions to Python-compatible modules. In our repository, Cython (with version 0.20.1) has been set as a sub-module in the "externals/Cython" directory.

>Note: Our code is directly executable on Linux platform. Re-compilation with Cython is required to execute them on Windows platform: See [how to run on Windows](https://github.com/wsdream/WSRec#usage)
